You want a mobile app for ERO Security with the following features:\n\n1.  **Shift Management:** Admins can load employee shifts (location, date, time).\n2.  **Employee Calendar View:** Employees can view their shifts on a calendar (read-only).\n3.  **Check-in Feature:** Employees can check in with date/time/location.\n4.  **Calendar Segmentation:** Calendar divided by events/locations for clarity.\n5.  **Timetable Generation:** Comprehensive timetable of hours worked per employee per event/location.\n6.  **Customization:** Ability to modify photos and background to reflect the company's branding.\n\nLet's break down how we can approach this with React Native and Expo.\n\nFor the UI, we'll leverage the existing components like `Button`, `IconSymbol`, and potentially `ListItem` for displaying shift information. The `Calendar` component will be crucial for visualizing the schedule. We can use Expo's location services for the check-in feature. Theming and customization can be achieved by modifying the `Colors.ts` file and allowing admin users to upload images.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T18:53:30.559109"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive security company app for ERO Security.
