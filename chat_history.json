The servers will compile your React Native app into native Android (APK/AAB) and iOS (IPA) files\n3. You'll receive download links for the built apps\n4. The build process typically takes 5-15 minutes\n\n## Key Features Configured\n\n- **App Name**: Changed to \"ERO Security\"\n- **Bundle Identifiers**: Set to `com.erosecurity.app`\n- **Location Permissions**: Added for the check-in functionality\n- **Icons**: Using your ERO Security logo\n- **Build Profiles**: \n  - Preview builds (APK for Android) - perfect for distributing to employees\n  - Production builds (AAB for Android, IPA for iOS) - for app stores\n\n## Distribution Options\n\n1. **Direct Distribution** (Recommended for employees):\n   - Use the preview build APK for Android\n   - Send the APK file directly to employees via email/messaging\n   - Employees can install it directly (may need to enable \"Install from unknown sources\")\n\n2. **App Store Distribution**:\n   - Use production builds\n   - Submit to Google Play Store and Apple App Store\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Run the build commands above\n2. Wait for the builds to complete\n3. Download the APK/IPA files from the provided links\n4. Test the apps on physical devices\n5.
